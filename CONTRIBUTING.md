# Contributing

Thank you for improving shared Twilic organization files.

## Scope

This repository hosts organization-wide community assets such as GitHub profile configuration under `profile/`, default policy documents (`SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SUPPORT.md`), and shared templates under `templates/`.

## Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

Use this format:

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Common types include `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, and `chore`.

Examples:

- `docs: update organization profile README`
- `chore: refresh community links`

Run `pnpm install` once to enable local commit-message checks via Husky. Pull requests are also checked in CI so every commit in the branch follows the same rules.

## Contribution Checklist

- Changes are limited to organization/community assets
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits
